# Advent of Code 2021

I decided to solve this years advent of code in **GO** for my computer science class

## Journey

### Day 1
Day 1 was easy. I had a bit of trouble finding my way arround go modules and packages, but at the end I managed to understand how it worked.

### Day 2
Day 2 wasn't complicated either. I was the first one of my class to solve the problem, though I wasn't nearly fast enough to make it to the global leaderboard.
It was also an opportunity to benchmark `fmt.Sscanf` vs `stings.SplitN` + `strconv.Atoi`. The latter combination ended up being significantly faster (~10x)
and used fewer resources.
